Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is in economic theory about the exchange rates of currency. It was created by Gustav Cassel in 1920. The theory is based on the law of one price: the theory that, in a perfect market, the same item should have only one price. Generally speaking, if a basket of good costs $15 in the United States and that same basket of goods costs £10 in England, then 1£ should be worth $1.5.
