The Eastern Catholic Churches are autonomous churches. They recognize the pope as their spiritual leader. They also agree with Roman Catholicism on most issues. They differ on ideas as how a mass should be organised, or which prayers are more important than others. A very well-known Eastern Catholic Church is the Coptic Catholic Church, located mainly in Egypt.
